For our project, we will create a website that will contribute to the services of an autorepair shop. The idea is to create an app that allows customers to login to an auto shop and request services and schedule appointments. The app should then be able to keep track of appointment openings and whether or not the parts are available for the types of services requested. If the parts are not in inventory, customers should be able to order them provided they will book an appointment. The user profile should also be able to keep track of past services done with the date and notes from the mechanic. Parts of the website should include information or pages containing:
* Customer Login
* Appointment Scheduling
* User Profile
* Services Requested
* Parts Inventory
* Mobile App
* Landing Page
* Notifications
* Vendor Info
* Parts Inventory/Order
